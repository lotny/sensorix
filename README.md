# Goal
To create a temperature monitoring system with the following functionalities:
* GSM notifications when temperature falls below a set threshold and when the system switches to backup power
* Ability to query the system for status and logs, as well as to change the temperature threshold remotely
* Waterproof housing with a LED display to present key parameters (temperature and power source)

# Hardware
* Arduino Uno
* SIM900 GSM module
* 2x DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensors
* UPS
